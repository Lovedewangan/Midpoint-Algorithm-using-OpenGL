# Ellipse and Circle Generation Visualization Tool
Overview
This C++ OpenGL project provides an interactive tool for generating and visualizing ellipses and circles using the Midpoint Algorithm. The application allows users to create geometric shapes through mouse interactions, adjust their sizes, and explore their properties.
Features

Interactive ellipse and circle generation
Midpoint Algorithm implementation for precise shape drawing
Real-time visualization with grid background
Dynamic size adjustment using mouse scroll
Circle fill/unfill functionality
Display of shape properties (center coordinates, axes, radius)

Technologies Used

C++
OpenGL (FreeGLUT)
Midpoint Algorithm for shape generation

How to Use

Left-click to set points for ellipse/circle generation
Right-click to clear the current shape
Scroll up/down to adjust shape size
Press 'f' key to fill/unfill circle

Key Components

Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
Midpoint Circle Algorithm
Scanline Fill Algorithm
Interactive mouse and keyboard handlers
